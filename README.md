# Sports-Equipment-Monitoring-System
Arduino-based system for real-time monitoring of sports equipment motion using accelerometer, gyroscope, and Bluetooth communication.
## Problem
Manual analysis of sports motion is inefficient and error-prone.

## Approach
Sensor data from accelerometer and gyroscope is processed using
embedded logic to analyse motion patterns.

## Implementation
- Arduino Uno
- MPU6050, ADXL345
- Bluetooth communication
- Real-time data processing

## Results
The system successfully captured and transmitted motion data
with stable performance during repeated trials.

## Future Work
- Data visualisation
- Machine learning-based analysis
